A pretty simple Steam store website web scraper.
It collects data from the Bestseller category and returns it in a .csv file. 
An example file of scraped data is attached.
Scraped data contains Game name, store release date and price - for almost 10k games listed.
Created mainly with Python's Selenium package.
